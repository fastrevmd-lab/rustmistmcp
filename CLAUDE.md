# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

`rustmistmcp` is an MCP server for the **HPE Juniper Mist cloud**. It has a Rust
workspace, pre-release packaging, and — since `mecmcp#90` closed — a real
outbound `HttpMistClient` wired into the production path.

**It has reached a live tenant.** A lab deployment runs as LXC **952** on
**pve2** (hostname still `rustmistmcp-610`, `192.168.1.212`), and on 2026-08-10
`get_mist_self`, `get_mist_org`, and `list_mist_sites` each returned real data
from `api.ac2.mist.com` in under 400 ms. That closed issue #11.

**952 is tagged `protected`.** Do not stop, destroy, restore over, or otherwise
touch it — check the tag, not this sentence, before any guest operation. It was
briefly VMID 610 tagged `disposable`; both changed in the 2026-08-12 renumber,
and 610 no longer exists in the cluster.

What that does *not* establish: the deployment is loopback-only with no TLS, one
org, one grant-bearing token, and three read tools. The `/api/v1/self` *startup*
identity probe is still unimplemented — the operator-facing `get_mist_self` tool
is a different thing. Mutating tools now exist for batch-1 WAN edge configuration
objects (networks, services, service policies, gateway templates, device
profiles), reachable only through the plan → digest → approve → apply lifecycle.
Delete operations and `mist_configured` device-profile assignment/unassignment
remain out of reach. Do not characterize local contract tests, an image build, or
packaging as v1, and do not read one successful read run as full packaging
acceptance — that checklist lives in `docs/PACKAGING_ACCEPTANCE.md` and is not
complete.

## Packaging boundary

Packaging uses the `rustmistmcp` binary/service identity, Debian 13, and exact
paths `/usr/local/bin/rustmistmcp`, `/etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json`,
`/var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json`, `/etc/rustmistmcp/audit-hmac.key`, and
`/var/lib/rustmistmcp/changeset-state.json`. The OCI runtime is digest-pinned
distroless Debian 13, non-root UID/GID 65532, and must contain no shell, package
manager, runtime fetcher, or extra executables. The LXC target is unprivileged
Debian 13 with `nesting=1`; never contact Proxmox, Mist, VMID 612, or VMID 613
from packaging work.

Task 7's shared CLI is checked in. Packaging uses `--device-mapping
/etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json`, `--transport streamable-http`, loopback
`--host 127.0.0.1`, `--port 30030`, the absolute `--tokens-file`, and exact
audit flags. Systemd uses journald; OCI emits JSON audit to stderr and must not
mount the host journal socket. Do not advertise a mutation-state flag or
live-Mist readiness. Graceful HTTP shutdown (`mecmcp#156`) and fail-closed file
audit (`mecmcp#158`) are wired and may be described as configured — but only
graceful shutdown's *configuration* is verified, not a drain under load.
External HTTP requires TLS plus exact Host/Origin policy. `--version` reports
the binary name and version (`mecmcp#159` closed); it supplements `--help`,
`BUILD-INFO`, and hashes rather than replacing them. Grant-bearing MCP
bearer-token lifecycle uses the shared `token_cmd::run_with_grant`
(`mecmcp#160` closed). Run `scripts/verify-packaging.sh` after delivery edits and build
archives only from a completely clean tree by default.

## The one architectural rule

This repo is a **consumer** of [`mecmcp`](https://github.com/fastrevmd-lab/mecmcp)
(local checkout: `~/Projects/mecmcp`), the vendor-neutral Rust foundation shared
across the mechub MCP server family. The split is not negotiable:

- **Upstream in `mecmcp`:** token auth/scopes/grants (`mecmcp-auth`), audit and
  redaction (`mecmcp-audit`), streamable-HTTP transport and limits
  (`mecmcp-transport`), CLI/TLS/shutdown (`mecmcp-runtime`), change-control
  state machine (`mecmcp-changeset`), inventory (`mecmcp-inventory`), the
  outbound HTTPS client (`mecmcp-http`), secret loading (`mecmcp-secret`), job
  polling (`mecmcp-job`), and the server scaffold (`mecmcp-server`).
- **Here:** the Mist REST client, its v1 API-token auth flow, response models,
  and the MCP tool surface built on them.

If you are about to write generic auth, transport, rate-limiting, or
change-control code in this repo, stop — it belongs in `mecmcp`. The extraction
is well past its early stage: fourteen crates exist as of `mecmcp` v0.8.8, and
every one of them is pinned here to a single immutable revision so extension
`TypeId`s cannot diverge inside one server process. Bump all ten pins together
or not at all. `PLAN.md` and `ANALYSIS.md` upstream describe what lands when.

Sibling reference implementations for the *shape* of a mechub MCP server:
`~/Projects/RustJunosMCP` (NETCONF/SSH, runtime hardening) and
`~/Projects/rust-panosmcp` (HTTPS XML-API, change-control lifecycle). Mist is
closest to the PAN-OS repo — an HTTPS API against a remote control plane — so
prefer its structure when adding the client and tool layers. `~/Projects/rustsdcmcp`
(Security Director Cloud) is the nearest sibling in kind: also a cloud
management plane, also at scaffold stage.

## Cloud control plane, not device plane

Mist is multi-tenant SaaS. One org-scoped call reaches every site and every AP,
switch, and gateway in an estate. Consequences that must hold in any code added
here:

- Mutating tools are reachable **only** through `mecmcp-changeset`'s
  plan → digest → approve → apply → verify lifecycle. Never a direct write.
- Read-only tools land first and stay the majority of the surface.
- Bearer tokens carry explicit tool, **org**, and **site** scopes. Org-level
  reach is the default failure mode of this API; scoping is what contains it.
- Responses are bounded and paginated. An org-wide client or event query returns
  orders of magnitude more than a single-site one.

## Curated tools, not a generated registry

The functional target is the Mist half of
[`nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp`](https://github.com/nowireless4u/hpe-networking-mcp),
which registers ~1,050 spec-generated Mist tools. **Do not reproduce that
approach.** Tools here are hand-picked and hand-documented. When adding one, the
bar is that an operator would name it; a bulk import of the OpenAPI spec is a
rejected design, not a shortcut.

Domains worth covering, roughly in landing order: org/site inventory, device
inventory and stats (AP/switch/gateway), site health and SLE, WLAN/SSID, client
connectivity, events and alarms, audit logs, troubleshooting actions
(ping/traceroute/bounce), RRM and rogue detection, firmware, NAC/policy, guest
access, webhooks, floor plans, Marvis.

## API research discipline

Several Juniper doc pages return navigation-only content to fetchers. Do not
write endpoint paths, header names, region hosts, or pagination behavior from
memory or inference. Verify against:

- https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/mist/automation-integration/topics/concept/restful-api-overview.html
- https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/mist/automation-integration/topics/task/create-token-for-rest-api.html
- https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/mist/api/http/guides/overview/mist-apis

Verified so far:

- Base path `/api/v1`, per-region hosts — `api.mist.com` (Global 01),
  `api.eu.mist.com` (EU 01), `api.gc1.mist.com` (GovCloud). More regions exist;
  the region is operator-configured, never inferred.
- Auth header is literally `Authorization: Token <token>` (the word `Token`,
  a space, then the token). Tokens are user- or org-scoped and inherit the
  creating account's privileges.
- Mist supports API tokens and external OAuth 2.0, but rustmistmcp v1 intentionally implements API-token authentication only.
- HTTP Basic auth with Mist login credentials is deprecated as of September
  2026 — do not implement it.

Everything else — the full region table, rate limits, pagination cursors, per-
resource shapes — is unverified. Record findings in `docs/` as they are confirmed.

## Conventions inherited from the family

- Rust edition 2024, MSRV 1.88, build toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Workspace lints: `missing_docs = "warn"`, `unsafe_code = "forbid"`,
  `clippy::all` warn, `dbg_macro`/`todo` deny, `unwrap_used` warn.
- Single MIT license (not dual). Repo name is lowercase, no dashes — mechub
  brand rule.
- `.gitignore` deliberately blocks `tokens.json`, `*.tokens.json`, `.env`,
  `*.pem`, `*.key`. Test fixtures under `crates/*/tests/fixtures/` are the only
  exception.
