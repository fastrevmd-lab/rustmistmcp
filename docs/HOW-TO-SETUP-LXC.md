# How to set up a rustmistmcp LXC from scratch

Builds one Proxmox LXC running `rustmistmcp`, in either **lab mode** or
**two-person** mode. Written from a rebuild performed on 2026-09-07, not from
memory: every command here was run.

Two rigs are normally built as a pair, because they test different things:

| mode | approvals | use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **lab mode** (`--lab-mode`) | waived on creation, recorded as `approval_waiver=lab-mode` | ordinary tool work, reads, single-operator change sets |
| **two-person** (no flag) | a second principal must approve before apply | anything that must prove the approval gate holds |

Never point a lab-mode server at production. It says so itself at startup, in
a `WARN`.

## 0. Before you start

You need:

- A Proxmox node, a container template, and a free VMID and IP.
- **The credentials the server will use.** A Mist API token
  (`/etc/rustmistmcp/mist-api-token`), a Mist profile
  (`/etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json`), an audit HMAC key, and a `tokens.json` bearer
  store. Building the container is the easy part; these are the part you cannot
  regenerate. If you are rebuilding an existing rig, back them up first — see
  [Rebuilding](#rebuilding-an-existing-rig).

Check the template is present:

```bash
pveam list local | grep debian-13
# local:vztmpl/debian-13-standard_13.1-2_amd64.tar.zst
```

## 1. Get a binary that will actually run

**Do not `cargo build --release` on your workstation and copy the binary in.**
glibc is forward-incompatible: a binary linked against a newer glibc will not
start on an older one, and it fails at service start with a loader error *after*
the old binary has been replaced — an outage, not a build failure.

Take the binary from the release image, which CI builds against the right glibc.
Pin by **immutable digest** rather than a mutable tag, so republishing the tag
does not silently change what you package:

```bash
# Obtain the digest for the version you want:
#   docker pull ghcr.io/fastrevmd-lab/rustmistmcp:0.3.0
#   docker inspect ghcr.io/fastrevmd-lab/rustmistmcp:0.3.0 --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'
# Then pin by that digest:
docker create --name mx ghcr.io/fastrevmd-lab/rustmistmcp@sha256:<verified-64-hex-digest>
docker cp mx:/usr/local/bin/rustmistmcp ./rustmistmcp
docker rm mx
```

On the workstation, glibc is 2.44; in the Debian 13 container, it is 2.41.
Forward-incompatible means the 2.44-linked binary will not load against 2.41.

## 2. Package the release

`scripts/build-release.sh` builds the tarball. Point it at the binary you just
extracted rather than letting it compile one.

**Important:** extract to the **gitignored target path** the skip-build branch
actually reads, not to the repo root — an untracked file at the root dirties
the tree, and the packager refuses a dirty tree before `RUSTMISTMCP_SKIP_BUILD`
is honored:

```bash
cd /path/to/rustmistmcp
target_path=${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
mkdir -p "$target_path"
install -m 0755 ./rustmistmcp "$target_path/rustmistmcp"
RUSTMISTMCP_SKIP_BUILD=1 scripts/build-release.sh
# >> Wrote dist/rustmistmcp-v0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

`RUSTMISTMCP_SKIP_BUILD=1` tells the packager to use the existing binary instead
of compiling. When the build is skipped, `BUILD-INFO` records
`rustc=unknown (binary supplied prebuilt; not compiled by this script)` rather
than naming a local toolchain that compiled nothing. The sha256 is still
computed from the real bytes.

> **Why BUILD-INFO must not be hand-written.** BUILD-INFO is the provenance
> record. A fabricated one — invented `rustc`, `commit`, and timestamp to
> satisfy the installer — is worse than none, because it claims a lineage that
> does not exist. During the 2026-09-07 rebuild there was no supported way to
> package a CI-built binary, so a BUILD-INFO was forged. That gap is now closed.

## 3. Create the container

`nesting=1` is **required**. systemd 257 degrades badly in an unprivileged LXC
without it.

```bash
pct create 618 local:vztmpl/debian-13-standard_13.1-2_amd64.tar.zst \
    --hostname test-twoperson-mist \
    --cores 1 --memory 512 --swap 512 \
    --rootfs local-lvm:4 \
    --unprivileged 1 --features nesting=1 \
    --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,gw=192.0.2.1,ip=192.0.2.10/24,type=veth \
    --onboot 0 --ostype debian \
    --tags "disposable;test;twoperson"

pct start 618
```

512 MB and one core is enough. 4 GB rootfs. The tags matter: `disposable` is
what marks a guest as safe to destroy, and the fleet's own safety rules key on
it.

For a lab-mode rig, change the VMID, hostname, IP, and the final tag to
`labmode`:

```bash
pct create 619 local:vztmpl/debian-13-standard_13.1-2_amd64.tar.zst \
    --hostname test-labmode-mist \
    --cores 1 --memory 512 --swap 512 \
    --rootfs local-lvm:4 \
    --unprivileged 1 --features nesting=1 \
    --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,gw=192.0.2.1,ip=192.0.2.11/24,type=veth \
    --onboot 0 --ostype debian \
    --tags "disposable;test;labmode"

pct start 619
```

Both bind port 30030.

## 4. Install

`install.sh` requires two arguments: the tarball and its `.sha256` sidecar. It
also requires an environment variable attesting that the host is unprivileged
with nesting enabled, which the installer cannot verify from inside the
container.

```bash
pct push 618 dist/rustmistmcp-v0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz /tmp/pkg.tar.gz
pct push 618 dist/rustmistmcp-v0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.sha256 /tmp/pkg.tar.gz.sha256

pct exec 618 -- bash -lc '
  cd /tmp
  tar xzf pkg.tar.gz
  cd rustmistmcp-*/
  RUSTMISTMCP_LXC_HOST_PROOF=unprivileged=1,nesting=1 bash ./packaging/lxc/install.sh /tmp/pkg.tar.gz /tmp/pkg.tar.gz.sha256
'
```

`install.sh` creates the `rustmistmcp` service user, installs the binary and the
unit, and stops there. **The service will not start yet** — it has no
credentials, and it says so.

## 5. Configuration and credentials

Four credential files are required, and all must be present and correctly
permissioned **before** the first start. The service checks them one at a time
at startup, so getting this wrong costs you one restart per file.

```bash
pct push 618 /path/to/mist.json              /etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json
pct push 618 /path/to/mist-api-token         /etc/rustmistmcp/mist-api-token
pct push 618 /path/to/audit-hmac.key         /etc/rustmistmcp/audit-hmac.key
pct push 618 /path/to/tokens.json            /var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json
```

Then fix ownership and modes:

```bash
pct exec 618 -- bash -lc '
    chown root:rustmistmcp /etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json
    chmod 0640 /etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json

    chown rustmistmcp:rustmistmcp /etc/rustmistmcp/mist-api-token
    chmod 0600 /etc/rustmistmcp/mist-api-token

    chown rustmistmcp:rustmistmcp /etc/rustmistmcp/audit-hmac.key
    chmod 0600 /etc/rustmistmcp/audit-hmac.key

    chown rustmistmcp:rustmistmcp /var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json
    chmod 0600 /var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json

    install -d -o rustmistmcp -g rustmistmcp -m 0700 /var/lib/rustmistmcp
'
```

**A real trap: `tokens.json` moved paths.** Older rigs kept `tokens.json` in
`/etc/rustmistmcp/`. It now lives in `/var/lib/rustmistmcp/`. A drop-in restored
from an older backup may still point `--tokens-file` at the old path, and the
service will fail to start. Check the drop-in and fix the path if needed.

## 6. The site drop-in

The shipped unit binds `127.0.0.1` and is deliberately conservative. Site
configuration goes in a drop-in, which keeps the shipped unit replaceable:

```bash
pct exec 618 -- bash -lc 'mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/rustmistmcp.service.d'
```

`install.sh` does **not** create this directory, because a drop-in is a site
decision.

For the **two-person** rig:

`/etc/systemd/system/rustmistmcp.service.d/override.conf`:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rustmistmcp \
    --device-mapping /etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json \
    --transport streamable-http \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 30030 \
    --tokens-file /var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json \
    --allow-insecure-bind \
    --allowed-host 192.0.2.10 \
    --allowed-host test-twoperson-mist:30030 \
    --allowed-origin http://192.0.2.10:30030 \
    --allowed-origin http://test-twoperson-mist:30030 \
    --audit-format json \
    --audit-log-file /var/lib/rustmistmcp/audit.jsonl \
    --audit-redact devices=hmac,host=hmac,name=hmac,basename=hmac,command=hmac,pfe_command=hmac \
    --audit-hmac-key-file /etc/rustmistmcp/audit-hmac.key
```

For the **lab-mode** rig, add `--lab-mode`:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rustmistmcp \
    --device-mapping /etc/rustmistmcp/mist.json \
    --transport streamable-http \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 30030 \
    --tokens-file /var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json \
    --allow-insecure-bind \
    --allowed-host 192.0.2.11 \
    --allowed-host test-labmode-mist:30030 \
    --allowed-origin http://192.0.2.11:30030 \
    --allowed-origin http://test-labmode-mist:30030 \
    --lab-mode \
    --audit-format json \
    --audit-log-file /var/lib/rustmistmcp/audit.jsonl \
    --audit-redact devices=hmac,host=hmac,name=hmac,basename=hmac,command=hmac,pfe_command=hmac \
    --audit-hmac-key-file /etc/rustmistmcp/audit-hmac.key
```

The empty `ExecStart=` is required: it clears the shipped one before setting a
new one. **That single `--lab-mode` flag is the whole difference** between the
two rigs.

**CRITICAL:** The empty `ExecStart=` clears the shipped command **in its
entirety**, including every flag in it. Any flag you do not repeat in the
replacement is silently gone. Both drop-ins above restore the full audit
configuration — `--audit-redact` and `--audit-hmac-key-file` — that the
shipped unit carries. Losing those flags leaves audit redaction disabled and
the HMAC key unused, so `host`, `name`, and `device` fields are written
unhashed. See issue #78.

Point both `--allowed-host` and `--allowed-origin` at that rig's own address
(IP and DNS name). A non-loopback `--host` requires **both**: omitting
`--allowed-origin` fails at startup with `non-loopback bind '0.0.0.0' requires
at least one --allowed-origin`. Origins include the scheme and port:
`http://192.0.2.10:30030`, not just the host. The two flags must move in
lockstep: whatever address clients dial must appear in both lists, or requests
are refused with 421.

Why site config belongs in a drop-in: the shipped unit carries the seccomp
posture. Replacing it wholesale silently loses that on upgrade.

Then:

```bash
pct exec 618 -- systemctl daemon-reload
pct exec 618 -- systemctl enable --now rustmistmcp.service
```

## 7. Verify

Check the four things that actually matter:

```bash
# 1. it is running the version you think
pct exec 618 -- /usr/local/bin/rustmistmcp --version

# 2. the seccomp posture comes from the SHIPPED unit, not a local patch
pct exec 618 -- systemctl show rustmistmcp.service -p SystemCallErrorNumber --value   # 1 (EPERM)
pct exec 618 -- grep -l SystemCallErrorNumber /etc/systemd/system/rustmistmcp.service

# 3. the filter is actually installed, read from the kernel rather than systemd
pid=$(pct exec 618 -- systemctl show -p MainPID --value rustmistmcp.service)
pct exec 618 -- grep -E '^Seccomp' /proc/$pid/status                                    # Seccomp: 2

# 4. it is serving, and refusing unauthenticated callers
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST http://192.0.2.10:30030/mcp \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'                                        # 401
```

`401` is the success case here: the transport is up and authentication is being
enforced. A `000` means nothing is listening on that address or port.

Checking `SystemCallErrorNumber` matters. Without it a denied syscall raises
SIGSYS and kills the process mid-request instead of returning `EPERM`.

**Note on the curl check:** `curl` is not installed in the base Debian 13
template. Run this check from the Proxmox host, not from inside the container.

## Troubleshooting

**Service fails to start with `non-loopback bind '0.0.0.0' requires at least one --allowed-origin`**

The drop-in binds `--host 0.0.0.0` but is missing `--allowed-origin` flags.
A non-loopback listener requires **both** `--allowed-host` and
`--allowed-origin`. Add one `--allowed-origin` line for each `--allowed-host`,
with the scheme and port: `http://192.0.2.10:30030` for IP,
`http://test-twoperson-mist:30030` for DNS name.

**Audit log contains unhashed device/host/name fields**

The drop-in is missing `--audit-redact` and `--audit-hmac-key-file`. When you
clear `ExecStart=` to replace it, you discard the **entire** shipped command,
including all audit flags. Both must be restored in the replacement — see the
drop-in examples above and issue #78.

## 8. Stop the rig

Test rigs here are stopped by default; started only when needed, stopped again
at completion.

```bash
# Use shutdown, not stop: the service persists change-set state to disk, and a
# process killed mid-write leaves non-terminal operations that block the device.
pct shutdown 618
pct shutdown 619
```

## Rebuilding an existing rig

Back the credentials out **before** destroying anything. `pct mount` reads a
stopped container's filesystem without starting it:

```bash
pct mount 618
cp -a /var/lib/lxc/618/rootfs/etc/rustmistmcp        /root/backup-618/
cp -a /var/lib/lxc/618/rootfs/var/lib/rustmistmcp    /root/backup-618/
cp -a /var/lib/lxc/618/rootfs/etc/systemd/system/rustmistmcp.service.d /root/backup-618/
pct config 618 > /root/backup-618/pct-config.txt
pct unmount 618
```

`pct-config.txt` is worth keeping: it is the network, resources and tags you
will want to reproduce.

Restoring `tokens.json` rather than minting fresh tokens keeps existing clients
working — the secrets are hashed and cannot be recovered, so re-minting means
reconfiguring every client that talks to this rig.

**Before restoring, verify the drop-in's `--tokens-file` points at
`/var/lib/rustmistmcp/tokens.json`, not `/etc/rustmistmcp/tokens.json`.** Older
rigs used the `/etc` path. Restoring from an old backup with a stale path will
fail.
